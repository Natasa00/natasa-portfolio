        My name is Natasa Kilibarda and I am currently studying web development
        at the Univeristy of Adelaide Coding Boot Camp. Some of the exciting
        technlogies learned are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap,
        Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Command
        Line, Git and many more. My passion for learning lead me to enrol into
        this boot camp and expand my horizons. Front end development is
        definitely my favourite. The future outlook is to contiue to develop my
        skills and experience. This boot camp provided me with a lot of
        knowledge and ability to meet like minded people.
